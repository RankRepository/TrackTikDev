				<h3>I run my security operations without automation.</h3>
				<p>Your daily headache: Your guard-reporting software is not exactly modern. It‘s actually pen and paper, which does not fall under the «technology» category, earning you no points for innovation in the bidding process. Or you still have technology that experiences 90s issues such as down time and uploading delays, or requires a fax and scanner, or worse... a pipe and wand!</p>

				<h3>I use several systems that are not integrated, for different aspects of my business.</h3>
				<p>Keeping you up at night: You use a variety of softwares: one for guard scheduling, another for payroll and invoicing, and a different system for patrol reporting. Oh and let‘s not forget your homemade Dispatch «software». Unfortunately, the data you meticulously collected in your numberous spreadsheet does not integrate in any of these softwares, creating siloed information that is almost impossible to analyze.</p>

				<h3>My clients and I are unable to make data-driven decisions.</h3>
				<p>#1 stress factor: You do not have access to reporting and analytics tools that will allow you to centralize the data collected in field, identify trends on sites and properties, or plan and predict for future incidents. Since you don‘t have a dear view into your data, you are unable to efficiently mitigate and manage risk. Your client is unhappy, you are unhappy.</p>
